Existing:

	Centralized online social networks collect and store 
private information and are thus prone to privacy leaks, ranging
from modest data mining for advertisement purposes to direct 
transfer of data to third parties.

Proposed:

	Decentralized online social networks (DOSN) 
that hide the data but reveal the access policies.

Future Enhancement:

	Hide the attributes and access policy of a user.
